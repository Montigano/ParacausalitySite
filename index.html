		<h2>Because the modern internet isn't that fun anymore.</h2> 

		<p>This website was created out of boredom and the desire to create a place where all of my projects and a few other things can be accessed with relative ease as I want this site to be as effecient and lightweght as possible while still looking nice.</p>
		<p>It may not look like much, but thats all projects really. So bear with me as I slowly develop this place further. And hopefully not at a snails pace.</p>
